How to Run the Project
1. Setup Prerequisites
•	Make sure you have Node.js installed. Download Node.js
•	Install MongoDB and ensure it is running locally or provide a MongoDB Atlas URI.
2. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository from your version control system:
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-root
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Node.js dependencies:
npm install
4. Set Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root with the following variables:
PORT=1000
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
Replace <your-mongodb-connection-string> with your MongoDB URI and <your-secret-key> with a secure string for JWT authentication.
5. Build the Frontend
If you are using a React frontend, navigate to the frontend directory and build it:
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
This will generate the build/ folder inside the frontend/ directory.
6. Start the Server
Start the server using one of the following commands:
•	For Development:
npm run dev
This uses nodemon for automatic server restarts on file changes.
•	For Production:
npm start
7. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:1000
________________________________________
Key Commands
•	Install dependencies:
npm install
•	Start the server in development mode:
npm run dev
•	Build the React frontend:
npm run build
•	Start the server in production mode:
npm start
________________________________________
Additional Notes
•	Database Configuration: Ensure your MongoDB service is running locally or provide a valid connection string for a remote MongoDB instance in the .env file.
•	React Development Server: If you want to test the React app separately, navigate to the frontend/ directory and run:
npm start
This will start the React development server on http://localhost:3000.
•	Static Serving: Ensure the frontend/build/ folder is correctly generated to serve the React app through the Node.js server.
By following these steps, you should be able to run and test your Todo App successfully.
