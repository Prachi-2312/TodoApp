In the project folder, you can run these commands:

npm start
Starts the app in development mode using Nodemon. Nodemon will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to your server code.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.

The page will reload if you make changes to the code.
Any errors or warnings will show up in the browser console.
npm test
Runs the test suite to check your code for errors and problems.

npm run build
Builds the app for production. This means it prepares your app to be deployed to a website or server.

It creates a build folder with all the files.
The files are optimized for better performance, and the names include unique hashes.
npm run eject
Warning: This action is permanent! You can't go back once you eject.

If you need more control over the configuration (like the build setup, Babel, or ESLint), you can eject. This will remove the default settings and give you full control.

However, you usually donâ€™t need to eject unless you're very familiar with React's tools.
